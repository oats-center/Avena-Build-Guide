# TimescaleDB
Setting up a TimescaleDB account with a Performance Tier involves several steps to ensure you can efficiently manage and scale your time-series data. Here's a comprehensive guide to assist you:
1. Sign Up for a Timescale Account:
 - Navigate to the Timescale sign-up page (https://www.timescale.com/).
 - Provide the necessary information and verify your email to create your account.
2. Create a New Service:
 - After logging in, you'll be brought to a page to create a service.
 - Click on "Save and continue" at the bottom of the screen.
 - Select the region closest to you followed by "Save and continue".
 - Select "Less than 25 GiB" followed by "Save and continue".
 - Ensure "Development" and "No replica (downtime)" are selected for the environment type and click "Save and continue".
 - No connectivity options are required so just click "Save and continue".
 - Finally, you'll be greeted with a service name and click "Save and continue".
 - Optionally, you can download your database config as a .txt or .env file to your computer for backup purposes.
3. Managing your Service:
 - Although there are additional steps shown on the top of the screen, you're technically done. To view your newly created service, you can click on "Services" in the column on the left.
 - Click on the service that comes up.
 - This dashboard is used to manage the status of your TimescaleDB deployment.
 - Scroll down to the bottom and note the "Connect to your service" section. This will be used later.
4. Configure Payment:
 - While a free 30-day trial is provided initially, it's important to set up billing in case you don't plan to check on your Timescale      account before the trial is up, in which case services could be disrupted.
 - Click on "Timescale Project Performance Plan" in the top left corner.
 - Click "Billing".
 - Click "Add payment method" in the wallet section.
 - Once you've filled out your payment information, you can return to the newly created service.
